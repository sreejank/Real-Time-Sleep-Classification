                 The returned named tuple fields are:

        >>>len(spikecounts)
        >>>4
        
    pl2_info returns a named tuple object, but in the above example the three elements have been
    unpacked already into tuples called spikecounts, eventcounts, and adcounts. The length of
    these tuples indicate how many channels were enabled, or had values in them in the case of 
    event channels (since events are always enabled).
        >>>spikecounts[2].name
        >>>'SPK03'
        
    Continuing the example, the third element returned in spikecounts (2 is the third element
    because tuple indexing starts from 0) has a field called name, which contains the channel's
    name, SPK03. Because you can treat named tuples like normal tuples, you could also get that 
    information by the index (because you read the documentation and know that the name field is
    the second element of the tuple).
        >>>spikecounts[2][1]
        >>>'SPK03'
        
    If you don't unpack the returned tuple, it's still easy to get the information. The unpacked
    named tuple has the fields spikes, events, and ad.
